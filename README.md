# Cryptocurrencies

The purpose of this analysis was to look at a few different kinds of crytocurrencies and using unsupervied machine learning, find out how they should be grouped and classified. This was accomplished by first processing the data with PCA and clustering via K-Means, reducing data dimensions with PCA, running the clustering on the cryptocurrencies, and visualizing the results with plot graphs.
